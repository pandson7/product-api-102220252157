- **Usage**: 10K-50K API requests
- **Coverage**: Mostly covered by AWS Free Tier

### Production Environment (Medium Scale)
- **Monthly Cost**: $0.31 - $2.00
- **Usage**: 100K-500K API requests
- **Key Services**: API Gateway ($0.10-0.50), Lambda ($0.19-0.95), DynamoDB ($0.02-0.55)

### High-Scale Production
- **Monthly Cost**: $20.60 - $205.92
- **Usage**: 1M-10M API requests
- **Scaling**: Linear cost scaling with usage

## Key Pricing Components

| Service | Unit Cost | Free Tier | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| API Gateway (HTTP) | $1.00/1M requests | None | 70% cheaper than REST API |
| Lambda | $0.20/1M requests + $0.0000166667/GB-sec | 1M requests + 400K GB-sec/month | First 12 months |
| DynamoDB | $0.125/1M reads, $0.625/1M writes | 25GB + 25 RCU/WCU hours | First 12 months |

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate (70% savings potential)
1. **Use HTTP API** instead of REST API
2. **Leverage AWS Free Tier** during development
3. **Right-size Lambda memory** allocation

### Medium-term (20-30% savings potential)
1. **Implement API caching** for frequent requests
2. **Optimize Lambda execution time**
3. **Use DynamoDB efficiently** with proper access patterns

### Long-term (10-15% savings potential)
1. **Consider Reserved Capacity** for predictable workloads
2. **Multi-region optimization** for global applications
3. **Advanced monitoring** and cost alerting

## Regional Pricing Comparison

| Region | Relative Cost | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| US East (N. Virginia) | Baseline (100%) | Lowest cost region |
| US West (Oregon) | ~100-105% | Similar to US East |
| Europe (Ireland) | ~110-115% | Slightly higher |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | ~120-125% | Highest among major regions |

## Break-even Analysis

### API Gateway: HTTP vs REST
- **Break-even**: Any usage level (HTTP always cheaper)
- **Savings**: 70% cost reduction

### DynamoDB: On-Demand vs Provisioned
- **Read-heavy workloads**: On-demand better for <3.6M reads/month per RCU
- **Write-heavy workloads**: On-demand better for <720K writes/month per WCU
- **Variable traffic**: On-demand recommended

## Scaling Cost Projections

### Conservative Growth (5% monthly)
- Month 1: $0.31
- Month 6: $0.39
- Month 12: $0.51

### Moderate Growth (15% monthly)
- Month 1: $0.31
- Month 6: $0.76
- Month 12: $1.67

### Aggressive Growth (30% monthly)
- Month 1: $0.31
- Month 6: $1.15
- Month 12: $8.94

## Risk Mitigation

### Cost Control Measures
1. **AWS Budgets**: Set spending alerts at $10, $50, $100
2. **API Throttling**: Limit requests to prevent cost spikes
3. **Lambda Timeouts**: Set appropriate limits (5-30 seconds)
4. **DynamoDB Auto-scaling**: For provisioned capacity mode

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **Daily cost tracking** during initial deployment
2. **Weekly cost reviews** for first 3 months
3. **Monthly optimization reviews** ongoing

## Conclusion

The Product API project offers excellent cost predictability and scalability:

- **Low barrier to entry**: <$1/month for development
- **Predictable scaling**: Linear cost growth with usage
- **Optimization opportunities**: 70%+ potential savings with best practices
- **Free tier benefits**: Significant cost reduction in first year

**Recommended starting configuration**: HTTP API + Lambda (512MB) + DynamoDB On-Demand for optimal cost-performance balance.
