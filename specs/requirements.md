# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Product API system that exposes product specifications through RESTful endpoints. The system will store product data in DynamoDB with a flexible JSON schema and provide API access to retrieve product information including name, category, brand, and other specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a database with flexible schema, so that I can accommodate various product types and attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL use DynamoDB as the backend data store
2. WHEN product data is saved THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in JSON format with flexible schema
3. WHEN product data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include mandatory fields: product name, category, and brand
4. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL allow additional custom attributes for different product types

### Requirement 2: Product API Endpoints
**User Story:** As a client application, I want to access product specifications through API endpoints, so that I can retrieve and display product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return a list of all products
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return a specific product by ID
3. WHEN a valid product ID is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return product data in JSON format
4. WHEN an invalid product ID is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
5. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL return responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data to be available in the database, so that I can test and demonstrate the API functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL populate DynamoDB with sample product data
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories and brands
3. WHEN sample data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate the flexible schema capabilities
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THE SYSTEM SHALL successfully retrieve the sample data

### Requirement 4: API Response Format
**User Story:** As a client application, I want consistent API response formats, so that I can reliably parse and process the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API requests are successful THE SYSTEM SHALL return JSON responses with consistent structure
2. WHEN errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return standardized error messages in JSON format
3. WHEN product lists are returned THE SYSTEM SHALL include pagination metadata if applicable
4. WHEN individual products are returned THE SYSTEM SHALL include all available product attributes

### Requirement 5: System Performance and Reliability
**User Story:** As an end user, I want the API to respond quickly and reliably, so that I can access product information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN database queries are executed THE SYSTEM SHALL optimize for read performance
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them without degradation
4. WHEN system errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL log appropriate error information for debugging
